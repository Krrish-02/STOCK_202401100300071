Key Features of the Project
This stock data analysis project incorporates several essential components that help in understanding market trends, volatility, and correlations. The main features are categorized into Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Technical Indicators, Correlation Analysis, and Data Visualization.

1. Data Preprocessing
Before performing any analysis, it is crucial to clean and prepare the dataset. This project starts by loading stock data from a CSV file and converting the date column into a proper datetime format. Sorting the dataset chronologically ensures that time-dependent calculations like moving averages are accurate. Additionally, missing values are handled appropriately to maintain data integrity.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA provides an initial understanding of the dataset by generating statistical summaries of stock prices, including measures like mean, median, and standard deviation. The closing price is plotted over time to analyze overall stock trends, helping in the identification of bullish or bearish patterns. Furthermore, daily returns are calculated to measure stock volatility, which is a crucial indicator for investors.

3. Technical Indicators
Moving averages are fundamental tools in stock market analysis. This project calculates 50-day and 200-day moving averages to identify short-term and long-term trends. Stock prices are plotted alongside moving averages, which helps in detecting trends and potential reversal points, aiding in strategic investment decisions.

4. Correlation Analysis
A key aspect of stock market analysis is understanding how different stock attributes interact. A correlation heatmap is generated, revealing the relationships between Open, High, Low, Close, and Volume. Identifying these dependencies is essential for risk management and portfolio diversification.

5. Data Visualization
To make data analysis more interpretable, multiple visualization techniques are applied. Line charts show stock price movements over time, histograms display the distribution of daily returns, and heatmaps highlight correlations among stock attributes. These visualizations provide deeper insights into market behavior, assisting traders and analysts in decision-making.
